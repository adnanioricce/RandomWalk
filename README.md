# A Random Walk implementation

This is a implementation of a [Random Walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), it's simple, using only the default .net random number generator to get a random value between -256 and 256 and calculate the next position of the walker. To better feel it on the screen, I set it's color to the current position on screen
